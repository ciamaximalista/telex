      <content:encoded><![CDATA["The incorporation of open source software (OSS) into workflows and infrastructure is increasingly common in organizations across Europe. The report indicates that 64% use OSS for their operating systems, 55% for cloud and container technologies, and 54% for web and application development."<br><br> «The reason for OSS’s popularity is clear, as the report suggests: by using it, respondents reported benefiting from increased productivity (63%), higher-quality software (75%), reduced vendor lock-in (62%), and lower software ownership costs (58%). Furthermore, OSS was seen as a gateway to greater transparency (49%), innovation (58%), and cross-border collaboration (48%). Overall, 56% of respondents believe the benefits of OSS outweigh, or significantly outweigh, the costs.»]]></content:encoded>

The terrible conditions—long hours, low wages, and an authoritarian environment—are, thankfully, a thing of the past for Kaewpaka.

Despite the conditions, Kaewpaka says he wasn't at all happy about its closure. Once again, economic necessity was determining his life choices. He and the factory's 700 workers demanded the week's wages the company hadn't paid them before closing, as well as severance pay. For three months, the group protested in front of the Ministry of Labor, setting up sewing machines on stairwells and attracting media attention. The three-month struggle further united the small group of workers and eventually led to the founding of Dignity Returns.<br><br> "The demonstrations stopped, but in the end we remained deeply united by friendship and solidarity," says Kaewpaka.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["At a critical time for access to housing in the Canary Islands, the cooperative approach to building houses is consolidating as a key player in the solution to the housing crisis. The severe shortage of new homes, coupled with a structural mismatch between supply and demand—with more than 11,000 homes in demand in the Canary Islands annually compared to a supply of barely 3,000 units—has created a massive housing gap. The situation is exacerbated by rising construction costs, a shortage of labor in the sector, and the lack of resources within local governments to expedite the licensing process, which makes the process more expensive and difficult."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The Karimata cooperative, on the tropical island of Miyakojima, Japan, is celebrating its third year of operation, fighting depopulation and bringing cooperative work to where it's most needed:<br><br> Karimata is currently in decline due to the emigration of young people, a declining birth rate, and an aging population. However, the culture of cooperation has been present in this village since before. In the history of overcoming harsh climatic conditions, such as typhoons and droughts, which it has suffered on numerous occasions, mutual aid has been cultivated as a form of lifelong wisdom. Symbolic of this is the self-governing association, which has been in existence for over 120 years, and the joint purchasing store, which operates thanks to the investment of 99 local residents.<br><br> Although they cannot be converted into monetary value, there are many necessary jobs that are indispensable for living in depopulated areas. In Karimata, transporting elderly people and children, mowing the lawns in the village, and organizing local events are activities that are difficult to convert into value in a market economy and are often overlooked in today's profit-first era. Since it takes approximately half an hour by car to reach the town center, supporting residents without transportation is especially important, but the shortage of workers is becoming increasingly acute.<br><br> "In the past, we used to introduce car-sharing as a city transportation service for students and seniors, and we conducted a demonstration experiment with Okinawa Toyota. What was revealed was the high financial cost of continuing the business. Since these businesses don't generate large profits, it's difficult for large companies to acquire them. That's why I believe the perspective and power of residents can directly solve the problems facing the local community."<br><br> In addition, they are renovating old private homes that are now empty and preparing housing and accommodations managed by the Cooperative Association. Companies associated with the Karimata area are participating in the renovation work, and local projects are creating jobs and economic circulation.<br><br> "Our work is nothing new. The lifestyle and local economic structure that the people of Karimata have long woven will be passed on to the next generation. That is our role."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Disney as a symbol of the end of social cohesion resulting from the devaluation of work since the 1990s.<br><br> Disney's philosophy began to shift in the 1990s, with the rise of its luxury offerings, but only after the economic impact of the pandemic did the company seem to fully abandon any pretense of being a middle-class institution. Today, a Disney vacation is "for the top 20% of American households—actually, to be honest, maybe the top 10% or 5%," said Len Testa, a computer scientist whose "Unofficial Guide" books and Touring Plans website offer advice on managing crowds and minimizing lines. "Disney positions itself as the ideal American vacation. The irony is that most Americans can't afford it."]]></description>
